<p>Jabberwocky</p>
<p>Lewis Carroll, 1832 - 1898</p>

   <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><pre>‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
      All mimsy were the borogoves,
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.
      
      “Beware the Jabberwock, my son 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
      Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frumious Bandersnatch!”
      
      He took his vorpal sword in hand; 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time the manxome foe he sought—
      So rested he by the Tumtum tree, 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood awhile in thought.
      
      And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
      Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And burbled as it came!
      
      One, two! One, two! And through and through 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
      He left it dead, and with its head 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went galumphing back.
      
      “And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
      O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He chortled in his joy.
      
      ‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
      All mimsy were the borogoves,
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.</pre>
